## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://brettsantor.github.io/password-generator/)

Welcome to my Password Generator Site! Tired of trying to think of strong passwords? Let my generator help you out! It can create a password including the alphabet in capital and lowercase, numbers and special characters all at your choosing. It will generate a password from 8 characters long up to 128 characters long, you decide!


## Usage 

This website is easy to use! Click the generate button and answer a few questions about what your password could possibly contain and it will generate one for you!


## Learning Points 


This was my first project using JavaScript so there was quite the learning curve. The generate function uses if else statements to parse throught the prompts and confirms. That information is stored into an array that is then used with the Math.random function to randomly select characters up to the number of the users choice and this whole party gets started with an eventlistener that triggers when a user clicks on the button.
